irssi-xmpp-notify
===================

My XMPP notification script, forked from @kreneskyp. It forwards all
notification events generated by irssi over XMPP. Supported types are:
* hilights (see '/help hilight')
* private messages
* join/part/away (see '/help notify')
* topic changes

This script now also supports GTalk(Hangouts) and other multi-domain
XMPP services. If the server you connect to doesn't have the same
host name as your JID, then use the "xmpp_notify_domain" setting.
This will only work with Google for as long as they will support XMPP clients,
which is currently unclear.

notes:
-------------

If you are using bitlbee or some other xmpp irssi client, that can possibly
make the notification messages loop back to your irssi, you might want to 
put the notification sending JID on ignore to avoid a feedback loop.

If you want to use this with a Google account you're in for some 'fun' 
for possibly painful values of such. Their XMPP support is degrading.
- You can't message yourself (Use a second account)
- If you use Hangouts, you won't get messages from non-Google accounts. You have to use a Google account.
- This might break completely due to Google at some point, consider Hangouts problematic.
