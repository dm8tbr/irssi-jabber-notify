irssi-jabber-notify
===================

My Jabber/XMPP notification script forked from @kreneskyp

Side note:
If you are using bitlbee or some other way that can possibly make 
the notification messages come back to you, you might want to put
the notification sending JID on ignore to avoid a feedback loop.
